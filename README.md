This set of code is for the control of the smoke flow visualization experimental setup at the FCET lab wind tunnel in UTIAS. 
Using an Arduino which receives input from the user or active grid encoder, the circuit outputs timed controls to the valve, heated nichrome wire and camera to create and photograph the smoke flow.
